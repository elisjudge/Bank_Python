# Bank_Python
A simple banking application written in Python. 

This program is a modified version of a banking application that I wrote as part of my Master of Data Science coursework on Object Oriented Programming.
The program was originally written in C#, however I have reimplemented it using Python.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: You need Python installed on your machine to run this application. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website:

2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd your-folder`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`
