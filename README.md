# Bank_Python
A simple banking application written in Python. 

This program is a modified version of a banking application that I wrote as part of my Master of Data Science coursework on Object Oriented Programming.
The program was originally written in C#, however I have reimplemented it using Python.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: You need Python installed on your machine to run this application. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website:
  [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone (PROJECT URL GOES HERE)`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd your-folder`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Version History & Usage
You can go back and review the code to see how the program changes over each iteration.

- Version 2.0: Added a basic terminal UI and simple validation rules for deposits and withdrawals.
- Version 1.0: Creates an Account, performs deposit and withdraw functions and prints balance to the terminal.
